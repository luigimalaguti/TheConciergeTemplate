# The Concierge Template

The Concierge Template is a quick and easy way to create the necessary projects structure for The Concierge to function properly.

## What is The Concierge?

From official [The Concierge](https://github.com/luigimalaguti/TheConcierge) repository:

> The Concierge allows you to create a simple project for the development of a ready-to-use Telegram Bot.  
The Concierge hides all the configuration part and allows you to use all your imagination in the business logic of the Telegram Bot.  
All you have to do is put the handlers in the handlers folder and specify them in the settings file.

For more detail about The Concierge project, see official repository.

## Quick-start

To start programming a Telegram Bot with The Concierge and Telethon packages, you can use this command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/luigimalaguti/TheConciergeTemplate.git
```

Or you can create The Concierge structure manually:

```
<PROJECT ROOT>
    |
    +-- handlers
    |   +-- <SOME HANDLER>.py
    +-- settings
    |   +-- settings.json
    +-- <MAIN>.py
```

## Running

After setup all data in *setting.json* and programming the The Concierge Bot, you just need to run the following command:

```shell
python main.py
```
